# Price-Prediction
In this challenge, I aim at predicting the price based on certain variables for the houses on Airbnb platform in Chicago. Airbnb is one of the largest temporary rental house platforms in the world, and they operate in over 220 countries. Now, we have the data from Airbnb regarding the basic information of the house owners in Chicago area. Airbnb is interested in the price prediction to have a better planning of their strategy in Chicago by understanding the effect of each variable (predictor) on the price. Therefore, in this challenge, we are going to use selected regression models such as ridge, lasso, random forest and so on to help Airbnb predict the price and discover and understand certain variables that affect the price.
